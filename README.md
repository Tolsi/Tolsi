### Hi there 👋

💻 I'm a researcher and developer

I love working with different technologies, do not dwell on something for a long time. 

Also I love to participate in bot programming challenges like mail.ru ai cup.

I develop professionally more for JVM (Scala/Java/Kotlin), but I have really different experience: C, C++(Qt), ASM (x86, Blackfin), Ruby, JS/NodeJS, C# and those things that I'm not really proud of 😅 like Delphi, Lisp, Prolog, PHP, XML, SQL, HTML and etc.

Hack all the things!
