### Hi there 👋

💻 I'm a researcher and developer

I love working with different technologies, do not dwell on something for a long time. 

Also I love to participate in bot programming challenges like mail.ru ai cup.

I develop professionally more for JVM (Scala/Java/Kotlin), but I have really varied experience: C, C++(Qt), ASM (x86, Blackfin), Ruby, JS/NodeJS, C#, Rust, Golang and those things that I'm not really proud of 😅 like Delphi, Lisp, Prolog, PHP, XML, SQL, HTML and etc. It doesn't matter to me what technologies to use to achieve the goal (if they are convenient and created for this).

Hack all the things!
